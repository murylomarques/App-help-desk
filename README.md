The Help Desk application is a tool that allows users to report problems, support requests, or questions directly to the technical support team. Through the application, users can open tickets and track the status of open tickets.

Each ticket has detailed information about the problem or request, including the date it was opened, the name of the user who reported it, and the current status. The technical support team can update this information as the problem is resolved or the request is fulfilled.

In addition, if a user has the administrator permission in the Help Desk application, they can view all open tickets, including those reported by other users. This enables administrators to monitor the progress of technical support and ensure that all requests are handled properly.

In summary, the Help Desk application is an essential tool for managing and monitoring technical support requests, and enables efficient communication between users and support staff. With its administrator permissions functionality, the application is also useful for managing and supervising technical support in an organization.
